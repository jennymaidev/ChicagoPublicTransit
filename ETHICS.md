# Ethical Data Handling & Compliance

## Data Privacy & Confidentiality

### Cook County Assessor Data

- **Privacy Considerations**: Property owners' names and sale prices are public. No personally identifiable information (PII) beyond public records.
- **Compliance**: No consent required; data is legally available for public use

### CTA Station Data
- **Status**: **Public Infrastructure** - Station locations are public infrastructure data
- **Privacy Considerations**: No private information; only station names, locations, and line information
- **Compliance**: No privacy concerns

## Copyright & Licensing Compliance

| Dataset | Copyright Status | License | Restrictions |
|---------|------------------|---------|--------------|
| Cook County Sales | Public Domain | Public Domain | None - freely usable |
| CTA Stations | City of Chicago | CC-BY-4.0 | Must attribute "City of Chicago" |
| Project Code | Authors (Mai & Zhang) | CC-BY-4.0 | Must attribute and indicate modifications |

**Compliance**: All sources properly attributed; licenses respected

## Data Use Restrictions

## Ethical Considerations

### Potential Biases
1. **Spatial Bias**: Analysis limited to properties near CTA stations; suburban/rural properties excluded
2. **Temporal Bias**: Data filtered to 2018-2024; historical trends not captured
3. **Economic Bias**: Analysis focuses on market transactions; excludes rental market

- Avoid overgeneralizing findings beyond Cook County
- Transparent methodology for reproducibility
